# Mushroom Edibility Classification

### Predicting Mushroom Edible or Poisonous

This dataset includes 61069 hypothetical mushrooms with caps based on 173 species (353 mushrooms per species). Each mushroom is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended (the latter class was combined with the poisonous class). Of the 20 variables, 17 are nominal and 3 are metrical.

This project aims at developing a machine-learning algorithm that will determine if a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. 

Libraries used:
* Pandas 
* Numpy
